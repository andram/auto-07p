Type "auto selec.auto" to run a selection of demos.

The results are then compared to the results of
runs on other machines. Such results may already be in files
in the current directory. Apart from the listed CPU time, 
there should be no significant differences between *_log07p and
hyper.all.
In case of suspected portability problems send the file *_log07p
to doedel@cs.concordia.ca and bartoldeman@gmail.com.

If the test fails completely (no AUTO output at all) then you
may have a Unix-related problem. First try to run a demo, e.g. ``ab''
in a clean directory (see the manual for details). If this demo
does not give results either then you may want to consult a system's 
analyst.
===================================================================
To run all runs of all demos, type "auto all.auto"
In this very comprehensive test it is likely that some demos will
give somewhat different results on different machines. This is to
be expected for very sensitive calculations performed on machines
of different architecture. 
===================================================================
To run a selection of HomCont demos only, type "auto hom.auto"
===================================================================
To run all demos that were also present in AUTO97, type 
"auto all97.auto"
===================================================================
To run some specified demos, type for instance
"auto demo.auto abc dd2"
===================================================================
To run the Python regression tests, run
"auto python.auto"
