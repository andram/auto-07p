2. A new @xxx command is create.
@pl
which should be put in $AUTO_DIR/cmds/
the graphics tool is called `plot3d' --- the coin3d version
which should be put in $AUTO_DIR/bin/
The @pl command is:

if ( test $# -eq 0 ) then
        $AUTO_DIR/bin/plot3d
elif ( test $# -eq 1 ) then
        $AUTO_DIR/bin/plot3d $1
elif ( test $# -eq 2 ) then
        $AUTO_DIR/bin/plot3d $1 $2
elif ( test $# -eq 3 ) then
        $AUTO_DIR/bin/plot3d $1  $2  $3
else
        echo "Illegal command"
fi


3. insert following code to .autorc
pl3     =commandPlot3D
plot3D      =commandPlot3D

4. insert following code to $AUTO_DIR/python/AUTOCommands.py

class commandPlot3D(command):
    """ Draw the solution or/and bifurcation using the 3D graphics tool
                                                                                                                                             
    Type FUNC() to draw the fort.* file in current directory.
    Other formats for this command are:
    FUNC('mu')             --- draw the fort.* files with the given mu.
    FUNC('mu','file')      --- draw the *.file with the given mu.

5. structure of directories.


$AUTO/
   |
   |-- plot3d --- keep the makefile and .rc 
   |     |
   |     |--- src  ---- keep source file(.c++) .h, Makefile, .rc)
   |     |--- include --- keep the headers
   |     |--- lib  --- keep the object file
   |     |--- bin  --- keep the executable
   |     |--- widgets  --- keep the widgets 
   |     |--- doc  ---- keep the help/manual
   |
   |--- bin  
   |--- cmds
   |--- python

The default plot3d.rc should be put at $AUTO/.
The script @pl3d should be put at $AUTO/cmds/.
The executable plot3d should be put at $AUTO/bin/.
The widget should be put at $AUTO/plot3d/widgets/.

DEPENDENCE:
The Coin3d should be put at /usr/local/lib
  libCoin.so.40.0.0  libsimage.so.20.2.2  libSoXt.so.0.0.0
  The above three lib must be installed.
