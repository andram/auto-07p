Known Problems :

 - The s-file orbit is not plotted correctly if, for example, the
   first two lines of the data set look like :

     1   20    9    3    4    1   41    5   87   10    4
       0.0000000000E+00 -1.0483288692E-26 -3.8282567843E-16  1.5654469197E+00  1.5654469197E+00
                                     ====


 - Axes labelling algorithm does not always work properly.

 - One should be able to select "A" ("all") after typing 2D while 
   one is already in the 2D mode.
