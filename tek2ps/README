This program will filter tektronix style plots to postscript output,
letting you use your laserprinter instead of the thermal printer that
tektronix has been selling since the dark ages.

I haven't been able to really test the defocussed Z axis stuff (no plot
programs that we have use it).

I have put as much as possible into the prolog file so a user can fairly
easily change the defaults I like to those he or she likes.  The tough
part about figuring out how this works is understanding the Tek addressing
schemes.  Other than that, it is pretty simple.  There is one `undocumented'
flag: -d, which enables more verbose messages when an otherwise ignored
character is encountered.  Usually, these are padding characters (4010s
are very slow by modern standards).

BE SURE TO EDIT THE PROGRAM (tek2ps.c, find def_pro) AND DOCUMENTATION
(tek2ps.doc, about the tenth line) to put the correct location
for the default prolog file in!

Any corrections or additions?  Let me know at:
