For installation instructions see the AUTO manual.  
The LaTeX source file of the manual is in doc/auto.tex. 

Note that you must define the correct path to the
AUTO directory in your (.bashrc) resource file.

This version of AUTO incorporates both a Linux and 
a Python command language user interface (CLUI).
