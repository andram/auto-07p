NOTE: this is a beta version of AUTO-07p.
It is already usable, but some of the demos and the manual
in particular need more work.
Please have a look at the manual, doc/auto.pdf,
in particular Chapter 1, for information about
requirements and differences with earlier versions
of AUTO. See the file CHANGELOG for changes between
sub-versions of AUTO-07p.

---------
For installation instructions see the AUTO manual.  
The LaTeX source file of the manual is in doc/auto.tex. 

Note that you must define the correct path to the
AUTO directory in your (.bashrc) resource file.

This version of AUTO incorporates both a Unix and 
a Python command language user interface (CLUI).
