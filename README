NOTE: this is a beta version of AUTO-07p.
It is already usable, but some of the demos and the manual
in particular need more work.
Please have a look at the manual, doc/auto.pdf,
in particular Chapter 1, for information about
requirements and differences with earlier versions
of AUTO.

With respect to the previous sub-version 0.3:
* AUTO-07p can now continue branch points in two parameters
  (Fabio Dercole)
* Includes all demos that are documented in the manual.
* The manual documents a new tutorial demo ('cusp').
* The run() and load() commands in the Python CLUI have
  been extended to directly specify AUTO constants, save
  and append files as parameters.
* A new splabs() Python CLUI function directly obtains
  special labels from a solution file (e.g., all Hopf
  bifurcation labels).
* You can now run the @ command (@dm, @R, etc.) directly in
  the Python CLUI without having to escape them with a !.
* The number of parameters printed in the bifurcation
  diagram files is now given by NICP; the parameters beyond
  the 7th are displayed as well.
* A higher precision for numbers is used in the bifurcation
  diagram files. This helps when plotting small sections
  of bifurcation diagrams.
* AUTO now allows free-form Fortran for equation files
  (.f90 extension).
* Parallelisation has improved.

For installation instructions see the AUTO manual.  
The LaTeX source file of the manual is in doc/auto.tex. 

Note that you must define the correct path to the
AUTO directory in your (.bashrc) resource file.

This version of AUTO incorporates both a Unix and 
a Python command language user interface (CLUI).
