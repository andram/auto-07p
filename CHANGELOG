0.5:
* PLAUT04 can now also use the SoQt and Qt libraries. That
  makes it easier to compile on various Linux distributions,
  and makes it portable to native Windows and MacOS X without
  an X server. Using SoQt also avoids some issues with LessTif,
  in particular on 64-bit systems where LessTif is unstable.
* PLAUT04 can now show label numbers in bifurcation diagrams.
  plaut04.rc option: "Show Label Numbers"
* The coloring method options in plaut04.rc can now be set
  seperately for solution displays and bifurcation diagrams:
  "Coloring Method Solution" and "Coloring Method Bifurcation".
* You can also set the "Label Sphere Radius" in plaut04.rc.
* The r3b (now with extensive manifold calculations), pp2, pp3,
  lor and bvp demos were updated.
* Some issues with g95 and Sun's Fortran compiler were solved.
* Likewise for the configure script.
* Repaired MPI regression in 0.4.
* Add support for ipython (auto -i) and also auto-quotes
  and auto-parentheses in the normal auto Python CLUI.
* Added some often used shell commands to the Python CLUI:
  "clear","less","mkdir","rmdir","cp","mv","rm".
* Added ex and dmf aliases for execfile and demofile to the
  Python CLUI.
* Added a GETMDMX(NDIM,P0,P1,NMM) routine to obtain the monodromy
  matrix factorization in PVLS (adapted from Kazuyuki Yagasaki).
* Corrected integral conditions for torus bifurcation continuations
  (bug well-spotted by Huguette Croisier).
* Added BPCont: code for BP continuation of periodic solutions and BVPs
  (Fabio Dercole).
* Added BPCont demos: sspg, lcnf, tfc, and abcb.
* Added @lbf, @ls commands, and the writeShort() and writeScreen() Python
  methods for displaying the bifurcation diagram file in a compact way.

0.4:
* AUTO-07p can now continue branch points in two parameters
  (Fabio Dercole)
* Includes all demos that are documented in the manual.
* The manual documents a new tutorial demo ('cusp').
* The run() and load() commands in the Python CLUI have
  been extended to directly specify AUTO constants, save
  and append files as parameters.
* A new splabs() Python CLUI function directly obtains
  special labels from a solution file (e.g., all Hopf
  bifurcation labels).
* You can now run the @ command (@dm, @R, etc.) directly in
  the Python CLUI without having to escape them with a !.
* The number of parameters printed in the bifurcation
  diagram files is now given by NICP; the parameters beyond
  the 7th are displayed as well.
* A higher precision for numbers is used in the bifurcation
  diagram files. This helps when plotting small sections
  of bifurcation diagrams.
* AUTO now allows free-form Fortran for equation files
  (.f90 extension).
* Parallelisation has improved.

0.3:
* The configure script is fixed for certain GNU Fortran
  configurations on Windows and has improved detection
  for the Coin and SoXt libraries for PLAUT04.
* Some PLAUT04 crashes were fixed.
* The MPI parallellization was improved so that most of
  the big data arrays that form the Jacobian matrix are
  split between machines.
  The distribution of memory enables AUTO to work with
  much larger systems.
* Both OpenMP and MPI parallellizations were improved
  so that the setting up the RHS, copying to a smaller
  system and inflation of parameter routines are done
  in parallel.
* An OpenMP parallellization issue with integral conditions,
  and several other small bugs were fixed.
* A few new demos and helper utilities were added.
* The 'total time' reported by AUTO is now the total wall
  clock time for both OpenMP and MPI.

0.2:
* The configure script is fixed if PLAUT04 dependencies
  are not available and is more robust.
* MPI support is ported from AUTO2000.
* A bug is fixed involving the continuation of folds with
  more than two parameters.
* Automake is no longer used for PLAUT04, using just autoconf
  and Makefile.in files for the whole project instead.
* Various performance improvements have been made.

0.1:
* This is a preliminary version of AUTO-07p.
