This is a start of documentation for the new AUTO front end.

shortBindings.py is my attempt to reproduce the commands from the
AUTO manual.

runDemo.py is the only module from this directory used outside this
directory.  Namely, it is used in util/test.py

test.py runs the regression tests for all the modules which
have a test function


NOTE:

Several source files have been copied from VBM into here.
Any changes to these should be folded back into VBM.
Namely:

	parse7.py
	parse8.py
	parseR.py
	graphics/plotter3d.py (used to be vbm_view_auto.py)
	graphics/vbm_util_pages.py
	src/auto_plotter3d.cc (used to be auto_physical.cc)	

NOTE:

Some files have been put into here from the Python distribution,
and will only live here until Sebius upgrades his laptop.
Namely:

	re.py
	code.py
	codeop.py
